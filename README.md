## Project Overview

NYCommon was a finalist submission to the [NYC Big Apps Blockchain 2019 competition](https://medium.com/@nycbigapps/announcing-the-2019-nyc-bigapps-blockchain-cohort-1b465268129f). 

The goal of NYCommon (New York Communities Online) is a proposal to improve connectivity between New Yorkers and the vital resources provided by city government, nonprofits, and community-based organizations. We are exploring how blockchain technology might empower users to identify and apply for public programs. Utilizing underlying blockchain technology would help identify eligibility based on an individualâ€™s unique profile. With NY CommON, users will be placed on a map that displays the closest resources available to them. Then, the platform will compile that list of resources into a comprehensive roadmap to help them navigate and apply to different programs.
